# Low Fidelity Prototype

## Wireframe/Wireflow: Part 1

I have here a rough low fidelity prototype of the app I want to create to show how to make a shabby chic picture frame bulletin board. 

I have a few screens including a home page, a hamburger menu, and two options to find projects to make.

## Self Cognitive Walk-through: Part 1

I have a few ideas to work through after doing my own cognitive walk-through that I need to compare to a user’s evaluation and walk-through.

## Wireframe: Part 2

With the advice of Professor Sookie, I have changed my design from a phone app to a desktop window screen. I agree that this would be best as a web screen as an app is very small. I also think the user would most likely use this on their desktop, rather than cell phone.

This is my homepage that has the name of the webpage (Wood Creations). I was deciding between having a hamburger menu for the user to click on to see the different navigation options and having them listed across the top.

Once the user clicked navigated to the page for “How to Build a Shabby Chic Bulletin Board” they would be brought to this page. It has an About page, a Construction page, Finishing page, and Bulletin Board page. That would be indicated at the top in either a different background color or text color to indicate to the user where they are in the app (visibility of system status and user control and freedom).

This is what the page will look like when the user scrolls down one of the instruction pages. It will have tools, the steps, links, if needed to outside sites, and videos or picture demonstrations. 



## Additional Notes 

* How I want to organize the different steps? 
  * Is it better to have a continuous scroll with no markers at the top? Should I have tabs of the three major steps: “Construction,” “Finishing,” and “Bulletin Board”? Or have an option to “Jump To” certain parts of the process (same three as above). 
* How do I want to allow for user control and freedom?
  * I made a hamburger menu for the home screen and added arrows at the bottom, but I do not feel that most apps are designed this way. I do not want it to be awkward for the user to have to navigate around in the app. 
* How should links work?
  * Do they stay within the app and open a browser in app, which I sometimes feel is awkward as a user. Or should it go out of the app and open in the phones browser of choice? 
  * Maybe have the option to choose “Open in Bowser: Safari, Chrome”
* I think there should be a spot for pictures of the final product somewhere in the app. 
  * Might need more pages in-between choosing the project and going to the project directions. 
  * Have a place for pictures, look at others projects they’ve uploaded, and then to click on “Project Details” for the step-by-step. 
* Add a help option?
  * Could this be part of the forum? 
* Need to do more research from interview subjects to ask about how they like to learn online.
