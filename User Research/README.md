**Interview with Thomas DiPressi** 

I will interview Thomas DiPressi later this week. 

**Summary of Findings**

I have interviewed Colleen DiPressi so far. We discussed how to finish a frame in a shabby chic style. For the frame construction, I will interview Thomas DiPressi at a later date. I have learned the tools and the steps and techniques needed to finish a frame so it resembles something shabby chic. Briefly, what is needed is paint, sandpaper, cork, cardboard, and glue. From the steps and tools needed this does not seem like an advanced technique. My interviewee had never done this before. Making a shabby chic picture frame was the first time she had tried the technique. For my personas and scenarios, I can assume that beginners can do this step. As always, though, instructions will be spelled out as clearly as possible so even beginners can understand. 

I might want to reinterview and ask about the limitations of learning this technique from the internet.
