# Progress Report 

## Emily DiPressi 

**Motivation** 

* I want to create an app that teaches a user how to build a shabby chic picture frame cork bulletin board. 

* In 2016 I wanted one of these for my bedroom, but my mom and I could not find the exact thing we wanted in any store and also in our price range. Eventually my mom and I found an old frame at an antique store and decided to use that as our frame and then we would make everything else and finish it in the way we wanted. In order for us to make the frame the way we wanted, we had to scour the web for directions on how to complete each step.

* My idea behind this is to create an app that will have all of the information together in one spot and it will teach the user how to do each step. 

**Lit Review**

**Research Plan & Method** 

* Video/phone call interview based on previous work. 

* I have made this project before with my mom but on an already made frame, so I will/have interviewed my mom about the finishing and creating a shabby chic look and how to make the bulletin board part. 

* My grandfather is a skilled woodworker. He has made picture frames for us before so I will interview him and ask him questions about how to make a wooden frame from scratch. 

**Design Fiction**

* The practice of creating a fictional prototype in an imagined world 

* Speculative design → design about yet to be realized concepts 
* “Something that creates a story world that has something being prototyped within it”

* “Using fiction to test the use and acceptance of unusual designs”

* For my project the prototype will have some imaginative aspects 
* Make an interactive video or do a very detailed/elaborate instruction 
* Instead of me making this, we will work backwards and create a fictional world
